# nesmapperprogram
Program to read NES ROMs based on iNES or NES 2.0 Header and Split ROMs for EEPROM Burning

NES Mapper Reader / Rom Fixer / Rom Splitter
Programmed by: Shawn M. Crawford [sleepy]
Last Update: February 19th, 2017
Latest Version: 2.0
Coded in C#, Requires .NET 3.5

This utility will:

    read NES ROM info based on the iNES Header (mapper, mirroring, etc)
    read NES ROM info based on the NES 2.0 Header
    clean a rom header by blanking out bytes 7 - 15
    remove the iNES header (to prep for burning to eprom)
    output the relevant BIN as a non-headered ROM
    output the relevant CHR/PRG bin files to burn with eprom burner for dev carts
    output the relevant CHR/PRG bin files to burn with eprom burner for Vs. Unisystem

Itâ€™s best to use the auto split option unless you know the PRG and CHR are incorrect sizes, since this info is based on the iNES header.

Example: Dig Dug (J).nes - see attached screen nesprog2.png
Results after Prep:
Remove 16 Bytes NES Header: Dig Dug (J).nes.bin (24576 bytes)
CHR dump: Dig Dug (J).nes.chr.bin (8192 bytes)
PRG dump: Dig Dug (J).nes.prg.bin (16384 bytes)

Requires .Net 3.5 Framework
